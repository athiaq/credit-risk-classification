* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Accuracy: 99.6%
  * Precision Healthy Loan: 1.00
  * Recall Score Healthy Loan: 1.00
  * Precision High-Risk Loan: 0.87
  * Recall Score High-Risk Loan: 1.00

## Summary 
The logistic regression model has an accuracy score of 94%. It is important to note that the there are significantly more values for healthy loans than there are for high-risk loans. The precision and the recall for the healthy loans is found to be 0 while the precision and recall for the high-risk loan is at 0.87 and 0.89. The oversampled data fits well with the logistic regression model. The precision and recall for the healthy loan is still at 1.00. The precision and recall for the high-risk loan is at 0.87 and 1.00.
